# Welcome to the Cenote Shoppe Shopping Cart App

By running this application using Node.js, you will be able to gather the gear you need to dive into the mysterious cenote as described in Part 2 of the [Azure Maya Mystery](https://aka.ms/AzureMayaMystery).

This app is built with Node.js. To learn all about Node, please visit Microsoft Learn's Node.js [learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-nodejs/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-chnoring).

Start by installing all the app's dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the shop by typing

```bash
node app.js
```

The app should be up and running on port `3000` on your localhost (http://localhost:3000).

Try adding items to the cart. If you can add the one item you need for this part of the game into your cart, the attached API will tell you what the code is to enable delivery of your gear AND reveal the name of the second glyph that makes up the mysterious temple's name.
